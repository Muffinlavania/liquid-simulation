ACTUAL WATER SIMULATION IN PYTHON DUDE I LOVE THIS ITS ACTUALLY GOOD TOO??

**idk**
its not optimized
you can either just watch it but pressing enter first (no reason to do this unless your pc is a potato)
'S' for selecting mode, gives you tons of placing options/deleting options, able to get random generations with K and stuff
